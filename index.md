## Outline of Course Evaluation Research

>- 1. TA Evaluation Questionnaire
   - Focus Groups: identifying questions
   - Cognitive Pretest: revising questions
   - Field Pretest: testing the questionnaire
   - Post-Fielding Interviews: Fine-tuning the questionnaire
>- 2. Student Satisfaction Survey
   - Questions about usability of the current course form
   - Field Pretest

--- #TA1

## TA Questionnaire
### Focus Groups

>- 1. Goals
   - What are the most important questions to be included?
   - Undergraduates vs. Graduate students: different goals!
>- 2. Sampling
   - Random sample of Stanford students
   - 6 undergrad groups and 4 graduate groups
   - 107 students participated
>- 3. Procedure
   - Facilitators used two different scripts: working with or being TA
   - Fall questionnaire as stimulus
   - All sessions recorded for analysis

--- #TA2

## TA Questionnaire
### Design and Pretests

>- 1. Text Analysis 
   - Recordings were transcribed and texts analyzed via NVivo
   - Identified more than 100 topics ranked by relative importance
   - Refined into 21 questions based on 85 categories of topics
>- 2. Cognitive Pretesting
   - Does the questionnaire cause any confusion? 
   - Participants: 5 graduate students and 5 undergraduates
   - Analyzed recordings to identify points for improvement
   - Questionnaire revised based on the interviews
>- 3. Field Pretesting
   - Random sample of 1500 undergrads and graduates
   - 409 responses; 319 effective

--- #TA3

## TA Questionnaire
### Finalizing

>- 1. Post-fielding interviews
   - 16 interviews (8 each)
   - Further identified confusing wordings
   - Collected suggestions for new questions

--- #TA4

## TA Questionnaire
### Responses to the new questionnaire

>- 1. What do students like about it?
   - The meaning of each question was very straightforward
   - It is comprehensive (covers all aspects of TA teaching)
   - Choices for response are consistent (5-point scale)
>- 2. What do students dislike about it?
   - Should have more questions for letting the TAs know how to improve teaching
   - Open-ended boxes: mixed responses

--- #TA5

## TA Questionnaire
### Some examples...

>- 1. How important was it to the TA that you learn effectively? 
   - Only the TAs know the answer?
>- 2. How uncomfortable was it talking to the TA? 
   - Negative worded; assumes talking to the TA "uncomfortable"
>- 3. How difficult was it to understand the TA's accent or pronunciation?
   - May cause biased responses to other questions?

--- #SS1

## Student Satisfaction Survey
### Design

>- 1. Procedure
   - Random sample of 2000 students
   - 512 responses, 356 effective
   - The current form was shown to the respondents
>- 2. Some results...
   - 61% of students said it was not difficult at all for them to interpret the questionnaire
   - 47% of students said it was slightly difficult for them to generate answers
